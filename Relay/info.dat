The relay option for 'SurvData' is to interact with a primary interface or secondary interface (usually a Pocket Computer) to send data to a 'Relay Point' to be used by
other 'Relay Points' or 'Pocket Computers', these interactions are usually sent out every two (min) to ten (max) minutes. When configuring your systems, you'll have the
option to configure both the primary 'Computer' to send its packets directly to any 'Relay Points' within its rage and allow those to transmit their data to another, or
use the 'Secondary Interfaces' (Pocket Computers) to sent data on the go to the 'Relay Points'
